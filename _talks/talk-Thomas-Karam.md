It is well known that if $$G$$ is an abelian group and $$A$$ is a finite subset of $$G$$ which
minimises the size of $$A+A$$ for a fixed size of $$A$$, then $$A$$ must essentially be as close as possible to being a coset of some subgroup of $$G$$: for instance, if $$G$$ is finite then the set $$A$$ must be a coset in $$G$$ (provided that $$G$$ has subgroups with size $$|A|$$), and if $$G = Z$$ then the set $$A$$ must be an arithmetic progression. One may wish to describe an extension of this phenomenon to more arbitrary functions than addition on abelian groups. If $$X$$ is a set and $$F : X \times X \to X$$ is a function, then can the structure of $$F$$ (to the extent that there is some) be read from the structure of the subsets $$A$$ of $$X$$ minimising the size of the image $$F(A, A)$$ for a fixed size of $$A$$, and can the “amount of stucture” of $$F$$ be read from how quickly that minimal size
grows with the size of $$A$$? We will discuss the progress that has been made in this direction,
starting with the results of Elekes-Ronyai, and what remains to be understood.
