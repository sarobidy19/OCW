Symmetrically self-similar graphs are an important type of fractal graph. Their Green functions satisfy order one iterative functional equations. We show when the branching number of a generating cell is two, either the graph is a star consisting of finitely many one-sided lines meeting at an origin vertex, in which case the Green function is algebraic, or the Green function is differentially transcendental over C(z). The proof strategy relies on a recent work of Di Vizio, Fernandes and Mishna. The result adds evidence to a conjecture of Kr√∂n and Teufl about the spectrum of this family of graphs.
