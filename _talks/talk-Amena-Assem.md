In 1980 Thomassen conjectured that, for odd $$k$$, every $$k$$-edge-connected graph (finite or infinite) is weakly $$k$$-linked. The conjecture is still open, however, in 1991, Huck proved that an edge-connectivity of $$k+1$$ is sufficient in the case of finite graphs. We prove that Huck's result extends to all infinite graphs, thus improving a result of Ok, Richter, and Thomassen from 2016 where they showed that $$(k+2)$$-edge-connectivity implies weak $$k$$-linkedness for $$1$$-ended locally finite graphs. This is joint work with Bruce Richter.
