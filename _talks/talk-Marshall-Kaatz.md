Ramsey numbers have gained notoriety over the last century for the difficulty of computing exact values or even improving known bounds, and have given rise to a large family of Ramsey-type problems. The classical theorem of Ramsey can be rephrased in terms of independent sets: in large enough graphs, either the graph or its complement will have a large independent set.

In this talk, I present a natural analogous problem to that of the classical Ramsey numbers. Observing that an independent set is a special case of an acyclic set in a graph — that is, a set of vertices which induces no cycles — we instead study how in large enough graphs, either the graph or its complement will have a large acyclic set. In addition to presenting key theorems and constructions, I will discuss some small non-trivial exact values and best-known bounds.
