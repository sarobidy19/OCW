It is well-known that the complete graph $$K_{2n}$$ on $$2n$$ vertices can always be decomposed into perfect matchings, called a $$1$$-factorisation. In such a decomposition, every edge of $$K_{2n}$$ appears in exactly $$1$$ perfect matching. This was generalised by Jungnickel and Vanstone to hyperfactorisations. These are sets of perfect matchings such that every pair of disjoint edges of $$K_{2n}$$ appears in a constant number of perfect matchings. Hyperfactorisations are examples of Cameron's partition systems and were rediscovered by Stinson who called them hyperresolutions. We generalise all these ideas to $$\lambda$$-factorisations of $$K_{2n}$$ and characterise them algebraically as Delsarte designs in an association scheme using the theory of Gelfand pairs. We use this characterisation to derive divisibility conditions and non-existence results. Furthermore, we explore a connection to finite geometry, giving rise to explicit constructions of $$\lambda$$-factorisations.


This is joint work with John Bamberg. It is based on ideas developed together with Kai-Uwe Schmidt.
