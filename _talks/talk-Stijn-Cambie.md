In 1991, Soltes observed that deleting a vertex of $$C_{11}$$ does not change the total distance of the graph.
He asked whether there are other examples.

This will be answered positively for the main generalizations of graphs, with even infinitely many examples.
For the main simple question, we create a better understanding, despite leaving it open.
