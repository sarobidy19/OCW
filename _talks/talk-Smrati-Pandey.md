The eccentricity matrix, ε(G), of a graph G is derived from the distance matrix by letting
the uv-th element to be equal to the distance between two vertices u and v, if the
distance is the minimum of their eccentricities and zero otherwise. In this article, we
study the spectrum of ε(G) and establish an upper bound for its ε-spectral radius when
G is a self-centered graph.
Further, we explore the structure of ε(G ◦ H), where G ◦ H is the corona product of a
self-centered graph G and a graph H. We characterize the irreducibility of ε(G ◦ H) and,
in this process, find that it is independent of ε(H), which allows us to construct infinitely
many graphs with irreducible eccentricity matrix. Moreover, we compute the complete
spectrum of ε(G ◦ H) including its ε-eigenvectors, ε-energy, and ε-inertia. Finally, we
conclude that several non-isomorphic ε-co-spectral graphs can be generated using the
corona product of two graphs.
