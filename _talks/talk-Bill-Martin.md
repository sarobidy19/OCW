Scaffolds are tensors that simplify calculations in graphs and association schemes. A special case gives us the homomorphism counts that one sees, for instance, in Lovasz's book "Large Networks and Graph Limits", But my primary interest the use of scaffolds in studying association schemes. In this short talk, I will give some elementary examples and list a few applications.
