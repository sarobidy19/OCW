A partial Steiner triple system $$(V,B)$$ consists of a set $$V$$ of points and a collection $$B$$ of $$3$$-element subsets (called triples) of $$V$$ such that any two distinct points occur together in at most one triple. We say a partial Steiner triple system $$(V,B)$$ is factor critical if for all $$x in V$$, there exists a set of mutually disjoint triples which covers every point except $$x$$. We will illustrate various techniques for constructing factor-critical partial Steiner triple systems, and discuss their distinct merits in contributing to an existence theorem.
