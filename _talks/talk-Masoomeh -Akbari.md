The Honeymoon Oberwolfach Problem (HOP), introduced by \v{S}ajna, is a recent variant of the classic Oberwolfach Problem. This problem asks whether it is possible to seat $$2m_1 + 2m_2 + \dots + 2m_t = 2n$$ participants, consisting of $$n$$ newlywed couples, at $$t$$ round tables of sizes $$2m_1, 2m_2, \dots, 2m_t$$ for $$2n - 2$$ successive nights, so that each participant sits next to their spouse every night and next to every other participant exactly once. This problem is denoted by $$\mathrm{HOP}(2m_1, 2m_2, \ldots, 2m_t)$$. Jerade, Lepine, and \v{S}ajna have studied the HOP and resolved several important cases.

We generalized the HOP by allowing tables of size two, relaxing the previous restriction that tables must have a minimum size of four. In the generalized HOP, we aim to seat the $$2n$$ participants at $$s$$ tables of size $$2$$ and $$t$$ round tables of sizes $$2m_1, 2m_2, \dots, 2m_t$$, where $$2n = 2s + 2m_1 + 2m_2 + \dots + 2m_t$$ and $$m_i \geq 2$$, while preserving the adjacency conditions of the HOP. We denote this problem by $$\mathrm{HOP}(2^{\langle s \rangle}, 2m_1, \ldots, 2m_t)$$.

In this talk, we present a general approach to this problem and provide a solution to the generalized HOP with a single large table, showing that the necessary condition for $$\mathrm{HOP}(2^{\langle s \rangle}, 2m)$$ to have a solution is also sufficient.
