Let $$F(n,m)$$ denote the set of triangle-free graphs on $$n$$ vertices and $$m$$ edges. The asymptotic enumeration of $$F(n,m)$$ has garnered much attention, notably with Will Perkins using methods from statistical physics to analyze the most difficult regime. The key structural result for approaching this problem is that a graph chosen uniformly at random from $$F(n,m)$$ is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s) not bipartite when $$m << n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$$, is a.a.s bipartite when $$m >> n^{3/2}\sqrt{ \log n}$$, and is a.a.s. close to being bipartite when $$m$$ is close to $$n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$$. We look to establish similar results for the asymptotic structure of a graph $$G$$ chosen uniformly at random from the set of triangle-free graphs on a degree sequence $$\boldsymbol{d}$$. Let $$M$$ be the sum of degrees in $$\boldsymbol{d}$$. In this talk, we discuss showing that $$G$$ is a.a.s not bipartite if $$M << n^{3/2}$$ for "near regular" degree sequences $$\boldsymbol{d}$$. If time permits, we will also discuss showing that $$G$$ is a.a.s "close to being bipartite" if $$M = \Omega(n^{3/2})$$.
