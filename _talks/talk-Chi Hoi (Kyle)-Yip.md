Recently, Adriaensen, and Aguglia, Csajbók, and Weiner studied a analogue of the celebrated Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem for one-variable polynomials over finite fields: for two polynomials $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$, we naturally say that they intersect if their graphs intersect. In this talk, I will discuss the same problem for multivariable polynomials over finite fields and highlight several interesting phenomenon that are unique to multivariable polynomials. Joint work with Shamil Asgarli and Bence Csajbók.
