Random walks are a simple but powerful way to explore the structure of a graph. This talk will provide an introduction to Markov chains and explain how their key ideas apply to random walks on graphs, and provide interesting graph invariants and parameters to study. We will focus in particular on Kemeny?s constant, an interesting and useful quantifier of how well-connected the vertices of a graph are. This talk will include a survey of recent results and open problems in the area.
