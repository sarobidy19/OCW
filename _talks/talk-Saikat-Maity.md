We prove several congruences satisfied by the generalized cubic and generalized overcubic partition functions, recently introduced by Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh. We also prove infinite families of congruences modulo powers of $$2$$ and modulo $$12$$ satisfied by the generalized overcubic partitions, as well as some density results that they satisfy. We use both elementary $$q$$-series techniques as well as the theory of modular forms to prove our results. 
This is joint work with Hirakjyoti Das and Manjil P. Saikia.
