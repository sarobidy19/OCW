2025-03-30 08:17,Sandeep,Sharma,,Tel Aviv University,Postdoctoral fellows,Yes,Multi-twisted additive codes over finite fields and their dual codes,"Additive codes over the finite field F4 were introduced and studied by Calderbank et al. (1998) as a natural generalization of linear codes. Later, Rains (1999) and Bierbrauer and Edel (2000) defined and studied additive codes over arbitrary finite fields. These codes constitute an important family of error-correcting codes and are also helpful in constructing quantum error-correcting codes. In this talk, we will introduce a new class of additive codes over finite fields: multi-twisted (MT) additive codes. We will study their algebraic structures by writing a canonical form decomposition for these codes and providing an enumeration formula. By placing ordinary, Hermitian, and * trace bilinear forms, we will further study their dual codes and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which an MT additive code is self-dual, self-orthogonal, and an additive code with complementary dual (ACD). We will also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a self-dual MT additive code over a finite field and provide explicit enumeration formulae for self-dual, self-orthogonal, and ACD codes over finite fields with respect to the aforementioned trace bilinear forms. Further, using probabilistic methods, we will prove that MT additive codes and their three subclasses of self-orthogonal, self-dual, and ACD codes are asymptotically good.",sandeeps@iiitd.ac.in

2025-04-03 13:47,Xinyue,Fan,,University of Waterloo,Graduate student,Yes,Critical graphs for excluding an induced even cycle,"For graphs G and H, we say that G is H-free if G has no induced subgraph isomorphic to H, and that G is critically H-free if G is H-free with at least one edge, but for every e in E(G), the graph obtained from G by removing e is not H-free. This is a natural notion that, although similar to the well-studied notion of ‘‘induced H-saturated’’ graphs, seems to have been overlooked. Note, for instance, that there is no critically H-free graph if H is a complete graph; however, there is no example of a non-complete graph H with this property. We conjecture that critically H-free graphs exist for every non-complete graph H. This conjecture has now been verified for a variety of graphs H, and the proof for the case where H is an even cycle is by far the most non-trivial of all. In this talk, we present a construction of critically H-free graphs for every even cycle H and discuss the details of the proof as much as time permits. 

This is joint work with Sahab Hajebi, Sepehr Hajebi, and Sophie Spirkl.",x77fan@uwaterloo.ca
2025-04-03 18:53,Blake,Shirman,,York University,Graduate student,Yes,Embedding decision trees to solve bivariate recurrence relations,"We start by showing how repeated iterations of Pascal's recurrence can generate a binary decision tree.  Embedding this tree into the integer lattice in a particular way reveals the familiar grid of NE (North, East) lattice paths.  While this is not a novel transformation, it begs the question: what other recurrence relations can be similarly transformed into a lattice grid?  We begin our search, appropriately, with a small modification of NE lattice paths.  We rotate our grid clockwise by 45 degrees and only count those paths that reach a certain high-point, but no higher.  Counting these ""high-point paths"" we see a similar recurrence to Pascal's, but more resistant to other methods of analysis.  After repeating our decision-tree-embedding method on this new recurrence, we only need to perform a reflection and rotation to see our familiar NE lattice, deriving a nice closed form for the number of high-point paths!  We close by considering some other bivariate sequences to see which might be amenable to our method.  Results on high-point paths comes from work on a recent publication by Acton, Petersen, Shirman, and Tenner (https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v32i1p15).",bshirman@yorku.ca
